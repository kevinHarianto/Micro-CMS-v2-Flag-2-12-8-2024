cuz I thought BurpSuite was the only way until I realized I used SQLMap wrongly, LOL.

Leverage the data from the POST request obtained in BurpSuite, READ THE PROCESS PROPERLLY, it will highlight MySQL type and how the username is injectable, you can preconfigure this but using Yes and No is enough for when the response comes.

Kinda wasted a lot of time through absurdly high Risk and Levels, when instead I could just focus on the MySQL type and SSL.
